# SecureDNS
Check for misconfiguration of a subdomain Names

## Overview
DNS Takeover is a cyber attack method where attackers gain control over a domain's DNS records, redirecting traffic to malicious sites. This can lead to data theft, malware distribution, phishing, and reputation damage. This tool is designed to safeguard domains from such threats.

## How DNS Takeover Happens
- **Expired Domains**: Attackers register expired domains to control their DNS records.
- **Subdomain Takeover**: Unclaimed subdomains pointing to inactive services are exploited.
- **DNS Configuration Errors**: Mistakes in DNS settings can expose domains to attacks.

## Impact of DNS Takeover
- **Data Theft**: Users are redirected to malicious sites where sensitive information can be compromised.
- **Malware Distribution**: The domain's reputation is used to spread harmful software.
- **Phishing Attacks**: Fake versions of sites trick users into revealing personal info.
- **Reputation Damage**: The domain's credibility and trust are undermined.
